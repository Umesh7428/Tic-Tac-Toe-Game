# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players, traditionally played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with their assigned symbol, usually "X" for one player and "O" for the other, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before their opponent does.
